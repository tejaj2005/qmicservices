# Stop typing twice 🙅‍♂️

A lot of projects use JSON schemas for runtime data validation along with TypeScript for static type checking.

Their code may look like this:

```typescript
const dogSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    name: { type: "string" },
    age: { type: "integer" },
    hobbies: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
    favoriteFood: { enum: ["pizza", "taco", "fries"] },
  },
  required: ["name", "age"],
};

type Dog = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  hobbies?: string[];
  favoriteFood?: "pizza" | "taco" | "fries";
};
```

Both objects carry similar if not exactly the same information. This is a code duplication that can annoy developers and introduce bugs if not properly maintained.

That's when `json-schema-to-ts` comes to the rescue 💪

## FromSchema

The `FromSchema` method lets you infer TS types directly from JSON schemas:

```typescript
import { FromSchema } from "json-schema-to-ts";

const dogSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    name: { type: "string" },
    age: { type: "integer" },
    hobbies: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
    favoriteFood: { enum: ["pizza", "taco", "fries"] },
  },
  required: ["name", "age"],
} as const;

type Dog = FromSchema<typeof dogSchema>;
// => Will infer the same type as above
```

Schemas can even be nested, as long as you don't forget the `as const` statement:

```typescript
const catSchema = { ... } as const;

const petSchema = {
  anyOf: [dogSchema, catSchema],
} as const;

type Pet = FromSchema<typeof petSchema>;
// => Will work 🙌
```

> The `as const` statement is used so that TypeScript takes the schema definition to the word (e.g. _true_ is interpreted as the _true_ constant and not widened as _boolean_). It is pure TypeScript and has zero impact on the compiled code.

## Why use `json-schema-to-ts`?

If you're looking for runtime validation with added types, libraries like [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), [zod](https://github.com/vriad/zod) or [runtypes](https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes) may suit your needs while being easier to use!

On the other hand, JSON schemas have the benefit of being widely used, more versatile and reusable (swaggers, APIaaS...).

If you prefer to stick to them and can define your schemas in TS instead of JSON (importing JSONs `as const` is not available yet), then `json-schema-to-ts` is made for you:

- ✅ **Schema validation** `FromSchema` raises TS errors on invalid schemas, based on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/json-schema)'s definitions
- ✨ **No impact on compiled code**: `json-schema-to-ts` only operates in type space. And after all, what's lighter than a dev-dependency?
- 🍸 **DRYness**: Less code means less embarrassing typos
- 🤝 **Consistency**: See that `string` that you used instead of an `enum`? Or this `additionalProperties` you confused with `additionalItems`? Or forgot entirely? Well, `json-schema-to-ts` does!
- 🔧 **Reliability**: `FromSchema` is extensively tested against [AJV](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv), and covers all the use cases that can be handled by TS for now\*
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Help on complex schemas**: Get complex schemas right first time with instantaneous typing feedbacks! For instance, it's not obvious the following schema can never be validated:

```typescript
const addressSchema = {
  type: "object",
  allOf: [
    {
      properties: {
        street: { type: "string" },
        city: { type: "string" },
        state: { type: "string" },
      },
      required: ["street", "city", "state"],
    },
    {
      properties: {
        type: { enum: ["residential", "business"] },
      },
    },
  ],
  additionalProperties: false,
} as const;
```

But it is with `FromSchema`!

```typescript
type Address = FromSchema<typeof addressSchema>;
// => never 🙌
```

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install --save-dev json-schema-to-ts

# yarn
yarn add --dev json-schema-to-ts
```

> `json-schema-to-ts` requires TypeScript 3.3+. Activating `strictNullChecks` or using `strict` mode is recommended.

## Use cases

### Const

```typescript
const fooSchema = {
  const: "foo",
} as const;

type Foo = FromSchema<typeof fooSchema>;
// => "foo"
```

### Enums

```typescript
const enumSchema = {
  enum: [true, 42, { foo: "bar" }],
} as const;

type Enum = FromSchema<typeof enumSchema>;
// => true | 42 | { foo: "bar"}
```
